🎯 1. Introduction This project is titled "Product Manual Question Answering System using RAG with Python and AI". It aims to build an intelligent assistant that can read, understand, and answer questions from PDF-based product manuals.

🔹 Built using Python, LangChain, FAISS, Hugging Face, and Groq's LLaMA3 🔹 Provides users with accurate, instant answers from long technical manuals 🔹 Makes technical support and user guidance easier and faster

❗ 2. Problem Statement Product manuals are often long and difficult to navigate.

Users must manually read through pages to find answers.

There is no intelligent assistant that can directly answer questions from PDFs.

Support teams waste time repeating information already available in manuals.

⚠ Need: A system that can automatically understand and respond to natural language queries based on PDF content.

✅ 3. Solution Overview The solution uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to:

Extract text from a PDF.

Split it into chunks for better context management.

Embed and store those chunks in a vector database.

Retrieve relevant parts based on user questions.

Generate answers using a powerful LLM (LLaMA3-70B via Groq).

📄 → 🔍 → 🧠 → 💬

This allows users to:

Upload any product manual PDF

Ask questions in natural language

Receive accurate answers instantly

🧰 4. Technology Stack Component Description Python Base programming language LangChain Orchestrates document splitting, retrieval, and LLM chaining PyPDF2 Reads and extracts text from PDF Hugging Face Embeddings Converts text chunks to semantic vectors FAISS Fast vector search for retrieving relevant chunks Groq + LLaMA3 Generates human-like answers using retrieved context Gradio Builds the interactive web UI Dotenv Manages Hugging Face and Groq API tokens securely

🏗 5. Architecture Step-by-Step Pipeline: PDF Upload → user uploads a manual

Text Extraction → uses PyPDF2 to extract all pages

Chunking → splits into chunks using CharacterTextSplitter

Embedding → vectorizes chunks using Hugging Face model

Storage → stores vectors in FAISS vector database

Retrieval → retrieves top 3 chunks relevant to the question

Prompt + LLM → feeds chunks + question into LLaMA3 via Groq

Answer → displays AI-generated response in Gradio interface

📊 Flow:

mathematica Copy Edit PDF → Text → Chunks → Embeddings → FAISS → Retrieval → Prompt → LLaMA3 → Answer 🌍 6. Scope & Future Enhancements Extendable to technical support, user guides, legal documents, academic PDFs, etc.

Can be deployed as:

Chatbot on company websites

Voice assistant

Enterprise internal helpdesk

Future Upgrades:

Multilingual support

Voice-to-text question input

Cloud or mobile deployment

Real-time chatbot integrations

🙏 7. Thank You Thank you for your attention! This system bridges the gap between complex documentation and user-friendly AI support.
